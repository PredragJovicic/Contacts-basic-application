# Contacts-basic-application

## Description

The home screen is held for 2.5 seconds and then opens a list of cantacts grouped by the first letter and sorted by surname. I made a contact entry without inputting an image (sets the default avatar) and is activated by clicking on the floating icon +, the new contact is automatically sorted. I removed the avatar of the icon from the net, that there are no basic ones from the adroid studio. Created with the Database class that simulates the database for entering contacts to make the application dynamic (if you delete the contact from favorites on favirites, it is also displayed on the initial one). I did not refresh pages after deleting from favorites, but only change the state of the adapter, the effect is the same. I did not manage to figure out which font was from the image so I used sans-serif. On the side of the contacts and favorites it is entered by clicking on the upper icons. The apk / release folder contains the apk version I tested on the phone. Platform is Android 6.0
